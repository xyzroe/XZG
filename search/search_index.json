Simply connect the XZG flashed device to your LAN Ethernet or USB, and you're all set.

You have the ability to establish numerous XZG enabled coordinators alongside a single Home Assistant setup. To achieve this, all you need to do is execute distinct instances of Zigbee2MQTT for each coordinator. According to user reports, approximately 6-8 LAN devices have been successfully employed in conjunction with a single Home Assistant setup. Furthermore, it's worth nothing that you have the capability to link with devices situated beyond your LAN network, such as those located in different geographical locations with internet access.</p> Is it possible to remotely update the firmware of the XZG enabled device without needing physical access to the device? <p>Certainly, you have the capability to do so. The two main chips employed in the coordinator (CC2652P and ESP32) can both be updated remotely from a different location.
